-- given two nodes a and b in a graph, returns all the acyclic paths from a to b.
-- if the source is the same as the destination, then the path consists of that particular node
-- otherwise, add the source to the result and compute the rest of the path
-- the rest of the path is computed in the following manner:
-- for each edge in the edge list (graph), such that the first node (fst edge) of that edge is the current source (same as for each outgoing edge)
-- choose the path by recursively calling paths with the new source (snd edge), same destination and the new edge list
-- the new edge list contains all the edges from the initial edge-list, without the selected edge at the current step
